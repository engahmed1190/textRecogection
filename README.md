# Arabic-Handwritten-Text-Image-Recognition
Convert Arabic Handwritten Images to Text

### Problem Statement: 
Given a Arabic handwritten word in image form. Convert it into text form or recognise the word and get the word in text form


### Solution Implemented:
Used 3 layer CNN to learn the features of Arabic Text. Fed that leaning into dynamic_rnn module with LSTM cell to predict the output.


### Results: 
The model is trainable and able to converge on small dataset.


### File Description:
#### train.py: 
to train the model
#### cnn_lstm_model.py : 
Implemntation of CNN-LSTM model using tensorflow.
#### configuration.py: 
Configuration file for all the hyperparameters and variable
#### helpers.py: 
contains helpers function to create batch to feed into model, prepare arabic character set and dictionary
#### Run.ipynb:
contains the results of training along with predicted result

#### Result:

### Further Work:
Need good amount of GPU resource to train the model on full dataset to get the Results.
